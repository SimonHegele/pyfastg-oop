# pyfastg-oop
A minimal Python library for parsing SPAdes FASTG files

Object oriented  programming version of pyfastg (https://github.com/fedarko/pyfastg)

A demo is included in the demo.ipynb jupyter notebook

Test data: I tested using SPAdes assemblies from RNAseq data from m. musculus and c. elegans.
           Unfortunately I was only able to upload a compressed version of the c. elegans assembly
